        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        </ul>
        
            
         <h3>Steps</h3>   
         <ol>
             <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). If using layers, grease and line the pans with parchment paper.
                 If using a 9 X 13 pan, grease and dust with cocoa powder. Sift together the cocoa, flour, baking soda and salt.
                  Set aside.</li>
             <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time.
                 Alternately beat in the flour mixture and the buttermilk, mixing just until incorporated. Add the boiling water and beat for one full minute.</li>
             <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.</li>
         </ol>
